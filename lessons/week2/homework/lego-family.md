# Week 2 Homework

## Lego Family
_[Due Saturday, 01/28, at 9pm](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1099807/assignments/3586665)_

### Goals
You will program your very own Lego family. You can base it off a TV show (Simpsons is shown below), a movie, a comic, or even your own family if you want. Check [Imagine by Lego](https://www.prote.in/journal/articles/imagine-by-lego) for more inspiration. This assignment will also help you practice with functions, variables, declarations and assignment statements. These ideas help make computations dynamic in interesting ways.

### Review
* Sizes are always given width before height
* Colors are given by three numbers called RGB for _red_, _green_, and _blue_ in the range 0 – 255. 
* `noStroke();` will remove the outlines around your shapes
* Positions on the screen are numbered from (0, 0) in the upper left corner and increase to the right and down
* A shape’s color is set with the `fill`, and once set all shapes are filled with that color until a new `fill` command changes the color
* Use Help > Reference if you are having trouble or want to look up how to use a function

#### Variables
* A variable holds a value that can change through the program
* Variables are important to dynamic programs, because values change all the time
* If more than one function needs access to a variable you should declare it at the top of your code (.e.g, `var position = 0;`) for now
	* Declaring and initializing a variable tells p5.js that `position` is a variable that will be used in the program and that `position` starts with the value `0`
	* If the variable `position` holds the value `21`, `position = 21;` and then later in the program, we write `position = 23;` then the value of position has changed from what it was (21) to 23

### Specification
* Your canvas size should take up at least 3/4 of your screen size; work big .. not small!
* Each character should be made out of rectangles, but feel free to add in more details with other shapes (like Maggie's pacifier—an ellipse)
* At least 3 different fill colors should be used for your family
* Your family needs to consist of a minimum of 3 characters
* Your code must use functions to structure your code (i.e, each family member should be defined in its own function)
* The use of parameters is optional but encouraged

### Task
1. Decide on the inspiration for your family
	* It can be a TV show, movie, comic book, or even your own family
	* Sketch out your family on paper, color it in, and label all the important points so it is easier to program
	* Note: you will be submitting your sketches, so save them!
2. Program basic family
	* Program your family in the center of the screen, making sure each character lines up on the same baseline (reference the Simpson family portrait below)

3. Add variables
	* At the top of your code add an x position and y position variable for each family member, then add these variables into your code to reposition your family at the corners of your canvas
	* If you have 3 characters, pick your 3 corners, if you have 4 characters use all 4 corners, if you have more than 4 characters you can have multiple characters start in a corner
	* Run your code, and make sure each character is now starting in a corner

4. Move your family
	* Program your family to move to the center of the screen
	* You will be adding statements similar to `x = x + 1` or `x = x - 1` to make this movement happen; consider the ball code shown in class

5. Stop your family
	* Finally, you will want to program your family to stop once it has reached the center
	* To do this you will want to use the `min` or `max` functions as shown in class

### [Submission](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1099807/assignments/3586665)
* Your code should have a top comment block with your name, last edited date, and a brief description of the entire program
* Each line in setup and draw should have a comment
* Each function that you created should have a top comment briefly explaining what that function does (note that setup and draw do not need top comments)
* Add your Lego family to your Github portfolio and submit a link to this project on canvas along with an image of your sketches
	* If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS also add your sketches to your portfolio

### Extra Challenge
* Add more custom details to your family
* Add an interesting moving background
* After the family meets in the middle, send them back to the edges, and repeat forever
