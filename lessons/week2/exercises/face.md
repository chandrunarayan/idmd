# Week 2 Exercise

## Responsive Face

### Goals

* Practice collaborating in code with others
* Practice using functions by modifying a basic face
* Practice using variables and conditional statements
* Explore the sound library

### Required Tasks

* Use the reference, use variables and conditionals to make your face expressive!
* Together with your partner modify the [basic face](../code/basic_face_plus/sketch.js) by opening sketch.js and copy-paste to the p5js web editor
* Notice how the different parts of the face is structured into functions and how similar facial parts use parameters within your functions
* Notice the comments around code blocks
* Make the eyebrows thicker when mouse is pressed - look up mouseIsPressed() function in reference
* Add your own comments
* Save as "responsive_face" project in p5js web editor


### Advanced Tasks
* Complete the Required Tasks plus ..
* Use the sound library, along with variables and conditionals to make your face interactive.
* Use [these code snippets](../code/sound_face/sketch.js) to make the face respond to sounds!

### Submission
Make sure your code is indented correctly and that most of your lines of code have a comment, then each partner should add this project to their Github portfolio.
