## Telescope & Astronomy Cascade Preview (15 minutes)

1. Bush Cascades is a 3-week experiential and immersion program on a interdisciplinary course of study. 
1. They are held 2 times a year at the end of Fall and Spring semesters in January and May. They are open to all Upper School students execlusing Seniors who will be doing their final projects instead.
