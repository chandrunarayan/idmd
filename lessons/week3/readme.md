## Exercises

* [Complete Week 2 Exercises: Moving Ball and Responsive Face](../week2/readme.md)
* [Dot Drawing](code/drawing_with_ellipses_0) - Look in Slack for initial code
	* Update to change to random color when mouse is clicked
* [Line Drawing](code/line_drawing) - Look in Slack for initial code
	* Update to change to add a tiny circle at the end of the line filled with a random color each time when when the mouse is clicked
* [Growing Ellipse](code/growing_circle) - Look in Slack for initial code
	* Update to make it look like a red giant star with increasing temperature with increasing size 
		* slowly increase the intensity of the Red color only as the circle grows
	* ADVANCED - Explode the star when it reaches the frame border and stop
* ADVANCED [Add a Reset Button](code/rect_hover) - Look in Slack for initial code - Modify this code to add a small Reset button to Projects. Ensure that the button is small and located at the bottom right of the canvas. It should work regardless of the size of the canvas.
