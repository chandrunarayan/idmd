* Extension of School Calendar to cover Cascade Weeks

## Week 8 Lessons
* ALL Teams: Motion
* ADV Team:  Functions, Arrays
* Split into STDTEAM/ADVTEAM Zoom Meeting Rooms or Individual Rooms for Async time 

### ALL Team Tasks
1. Review HW due after Comments Break 
1. Review Upcoming Topics on Motion
   *  Translate, Rotate, Push, Pop, Scale (Chapter 6)
   *  Wrap, Bounce, Tween, Shake, Circle, Wave, Spiral (Chapter 8)

### STD Team Tasks

1. Study and practice techniques for Motion Chapter 8 in Online textbook: [Getting Started with P5JS](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/15GK0VESxqTvYGst9EtvILshb0MGlO4c5)
1. [Complete Moving Pacman Exercise](code/moving_pacman.md)

### ADV Team Tasks
1. Modularize your Robot project from Week 1 with a custom drawRobot() user defined Function.
1. Animate your Robot using techniques from Chapters 6 and 8
1. Create an Array of Robots by repeatedly calling your custom function. Refer to Chapter 9.8 and Chapters 10-11 in your Online textbook: [Getting Started with P5JS](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/15GK0VESxqTvYGst9EtvILshb0MGlO4c5)
