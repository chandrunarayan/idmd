## Creative Animation Project

### Goals
The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to combine techniques learned in the last 3 weeks to produce an interesting animation with user interactions.

### Specification
In this assignment you should combine each of the following Javascript concepts into one creative animation.

Your program should include for loops, arrays, functions with parameters, custom fonts with color with a smooth visual build of lines or shapes. The code exercise samples [here](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/lessons/week5/code/) and [here](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/lessons/week7/) should provide plenty of examples to produce interesting and original work.

This is a much more challenging assignment as you are combining multiple concepts to come up with your final work. You should complete your program in stages, and reach out to me if you get stuck or need any help along the way.

### Tips
* Choose or create a small dataset for animating your objects
* Sketch and plan your ideas before you start to code
* Start small, get small pieces working first; don't try and write your code all at once
* Add in the user interactions last, after you get the visual representation of the data working

### Submission
* Your code should have a top comment block with your name, last edited date, and a brief description of the entire program
* Each line in setup and draw should have a comment
* Each function that you created should have a top comment briefly explaining what that function does (note that setup and draw do not need top comments)
* Add your creative animation project to your Github portfolio
	* If you are comfortable with HTML, you can ad some images/video
