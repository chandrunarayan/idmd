# Week 4 Code Specifications

The In-Class Exercises and Creativity Exploration Project for week 4 is intended to demonstrate your coding skill to produce the visual elements you see linked below. 

You can use these ideas and code extracts in Slack as a starting points for your assignments this week.  Look in both the General and Visual Programming channels. 

Your artwork for all assignments should be original and should significantly deviate in design, structure and output from the examples below.  You can use the principles shown below in the extracts. Both the In-Class Exercises and Creativity Exploration Projects are due on Monday, March 2nd before class starts.

The "Standard Pathway" students should complete these assignments in paired teams. Each student must submit all of their individual and team work into Github separately for it to count towards your grade.

The "Advanced Pathway" students should complete these assignments individually. Each student must submit all of their individual work into Github for it to count towards your grade.

In-class Exercises (see Slack "General" channel for code extracts)

Submit these as separate projects into Github. You might also consider combining ALL of the visusal elements below into a single submission to Github! 
* [Key Typed Red Green Blue for Character key response](keyTypedRedGreenBlue)
* [Key Pressed Moving Ball for Arrow key response](keyIsPressedMovingBall)
* [Modified Moving Ball for showing while loop](modifiedMovingBall)
* [Font Example](fontExample)
* [Image Example](imageExample)
* [Ellipse Grid](ellipseGrid)
* [Ellipse Grid 2](ellipseGrid2)
* [Gradients](gradients)
* [Gradients 2](gradients2)

Creativity Exploration Project (see Slack "Visual Programming" channel for code extracts).
