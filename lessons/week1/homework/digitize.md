# Week 1 Homework

## Digitzie an analog piece of art
### Goal 
In this programming assignment you will practice all the skills you learned in the first day of class, by recreating an analog piece of art in a digital format using p5.js

### Part 1: Choose a piece of art
Locate a piece of art that inspires you, for this project it is best if you choose a painting or drawing with geometric like shapes. A few resources are linked below, but feel free to look elsewhere

* [Harvard Art Museums Collections](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections?)
* [Museum of Modern Art Collections](http://www.moma.org/collection/)
* [Artstror](http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=http://www.artstor.org/index.shtml) Note: You will need to login with your UW netid for full access
* [Oxford Art Online](http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/) Note: You will need to login with your UW netid for full access

Download the image, and decide either to reproduce the entire artwork or select a crop of the artwork (this is best for artworks with lots of details). If you need help cropping your image, reach out to your instructional team. You will need to turn in either the entire image or the crop depending on what you decide.

### Part 2: Make a Plan
Plan out what shapes you will use in p5.js to represent the shapes in the artwork, draw it out by hand so you have a guide to work from. 

You will also want to plan out the colors you plan to use. You will more than likely want to use Photoshop, Gimp, or another piece of software to pull the RGB color values from the artwork. If you need help with this please reach out to your instructor.

You do not need to directly replicate the artwork, instead use it as inspiration to create a digital version.

### Part 3: Write the code
Write your static code (no draw function needed) in p5.js making sure to include comments as you go that explain your code. We highly recommend that you run your code often so you can discover errors along the way instead of waiting until the very end.

In most situations we expect you to use many different kinds of p5.js functions including but not limited to `line`, `triangle`, `quad`, `rect`, `ellipse`, `arc`, `stroke`, `fill`, and `background`. 

### Submission
Make sure your code has a comment on most every line and then add your project to your Github portfolio website. If you have any trouble adding it to your portfolio please reach out to your instructor. Then you should submit your reference image and link to your Github portfolio on Google Drive
