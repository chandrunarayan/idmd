[_Bush School IDMD Spring Semester 2021_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/)


# IDMD - Interactive Digital Media Design
Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. This course is an introduction to computer programming within the context of the visual art. Students in this course will learn the fundamentals of computer programming -- conditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to games, machine-learning inspired art, simulations of physical, biological and social phenomena.

We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. Below is an example of a game you could develop using P5JS and Javascript!

This course will be all about developing skills to simulate nature on your computer in a fun, engaging manner and learn Javascript on the side!</a>

## Remote/Hybrid Classroom Applications

In our IDMD classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning IDMD.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop.

#### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to be safe and considerate of others. Let us take time to be vigilant about wearing masks, washing hands, not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control.

## Learning Modes and Typical Student Workflow
### Learning by Doing First - Student-Based Asynchronous Workflow
In this mode of learning we will simultaneously start a consolidatded student-paced session spanning multiple P5JS topics, supported by working on visual and creative projects within Paired Programming teams. Subsequently we will use the [online text books](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_zq8eZnKCsoD5Y-22_pZfTbOgZg2dwmB?usp=sharing) for a more complete discussion of ideas and creative extensions. We will mostly be using this workflow model, switching to Synchronous in small bursts as directed by your teacher or as needed to support student needs.
### Doing by Learning First - Lecture-Based Synchronous Workflow
We will use this method of learning sparingly, reserved for difficult topics that might require a lecture-based instructional unit.  The lectures below are designed in that manner and always available as a reference while we live in the world of Asynchronous "Learning by Doing First" model above.
