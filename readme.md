[_Bush School IDMD Spring Semester 2021_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/)

# IDMD - Interactive Digital Media Design
Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. This course is an introduction to computer programming within the context of the visual art. Students in this course will learn the fundamentals of computer programming -- conditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to games, machine-learning inspired art, simulations of physical, biological and social phenomena.

We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. To see examples of the interactive digital media you can create with code, watch this video by the creators of p5.js.
## Remote Classroom Tools

In our IDMD classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning IDMD.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop.

#### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to think about those among us who are suffering due to this affliction. Let us take time to be vigilant about [washing hands frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control.

## Course Description

Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Students will explore the essentials of Computer Programming including: cconditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to video games, installation art, and simulations of biological and social phenomena. We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. To see examples of the interactive digital media you can create with code, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE) by the creators of p5.js.
